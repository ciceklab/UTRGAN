# UTRGAN: Learning to Generate 5' UTR Sequences for Optimized Translation Efficiency and Gene Expression



> UTRGAN is a is a deep learning based model for novel 5' UTR generation and optimziation. We use the WGAN-GP architecture for the generative model, and the Xpresso, FramePool, and MTtrans models for optimizing the TPM expression, Mean Ribosome Load (MRL), and Translation Efficiency (TE), respectively.

## Installation

- UTRGAN is easy to use and does not require installation. The scripts can be used if the requirements are installed.

### Requirements

For easy requirement handling, you can use utrgan.yml files to initialize conda environment with requirements installed:

```shell
$ conda env create --name utrgan -f utrgan.yml
$ conda activate utrgan
```

Note that the provided environment yml file is for Linux systems. For MacOS users, the corresponding versions of the packages might need to be changed.

## Features

- UTRGAN components are trained using GPUs and GPUs are used for the project. However, depending on the type of Tensorflow <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">**Tensorflow**</a> the model can run on both GPU and CPU. The run time on CPU is considerably longer compared to GPU.


## Instructions Manual
Important notice: Please call the wgan.py script from the ./src/gan directory. The optimization scripts for gene expression and MRL/TE are in the ./src/exp_optimization and ./src/mrl_te_optimization directories, respectively. To analyze the generated seqeunces use the ./src/analysis/violin_dists.py script.

./src/exp_optimization/multiple_genes.py

./src/exp_optimization/single_gene.py -g [IFNG, TNF, TLR6, TP53]

./src/exp_optimization/joint_opt.py -g [IFNG, TNF, TLR6, TP53]

To reproduce plots:

./analysis/violin_plots.py

./analysis/plot_4x4.py

./analysis/opt_check.py

./analysis/mrl_te_opt.py

./src/exp_optimization/exp_joint.py

All the plots will be in: ./analysis/plots/

The p-values, confidence intervals and effect sizes will be printed in the terminal output of the "violin_plots.py" script

The average and maximum increase statistics will be printed for each boxplot generating script

## Usage Examples

> Usage of UTRGAN is very simple. You need to install conda to install the specific environment and run the scripts.

### Step-0: Install conda package management

- This project uses conda package management software to create virtual environment and facilitate reproducability.

- For Linux users:
 - Please take a look at the <a href="https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/" target="_blank">**Anaconda repo archive page**</a>, and select an appropriate version that you'd like to install.
 - Replace this `Anaconda3-version.num-Linux-x86_64.sh` with your choice

```shell
$ wget -c https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-vers.num-Linux-x86_64.sh
$ bash Anaconda3-version.num-Linux-x86_64.sh
```


### Step-1: Set Up your environment.

- It is important to set up the conda environment which includes the necessary dependencies.
- Please run the following lines to create and activate the environment:

```shell
$ conda env create --name utrgan -f utrgan.yml
$ conda activate utrgan
```
